# FeaturePatterns

Call them how you like: specifications, features, requirements, epics, tasks, user stories, use cases, usage scenarios.

In the world of "FeaturePatterns", I call all of put all of these under the umbrella of "feature set" & "item of feature set".

But what matters most is not how you call these, but how useful they become to you. And indeed, how could any team work together without ever writting down and organizing ideas for a project?

## Patterns

This repo lists common feature sets, I came across many of these several times so decided it was time for me to think of a clever way to help me & others not to repeat themselves (DRY).

### Functional vs non-functional requirements

I roughly broke the feature sets in 2 categories:
 - Functional requirement: describe the behavior of the system, activities users must perform (i.e. sign-in, product-page)
 - Non-functional requirements: specify the quality of the system (performance, quality, security & more: i.e. browser & device support).

### Functional requirements as user stories

The items of the functional requirements are most often expressed as user stories for now.

Things are kept very simple for now, so only very generic personas are used if any.

## Keeping things simple

Things are kept as simple as possible for now: only text is used.

This is to make sure the focus is kept on the core of the mission: gather as many features sets as possible.

Any mock ups, illustration, or example should be linked to some external page.

Any info that is too project-dependent (i.e. estimation, priority) must be removed.
